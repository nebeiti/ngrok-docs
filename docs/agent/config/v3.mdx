## Endpoint configurations

> **Looking for Tunnel configurations?**
>
> (Deprecated)_Tunnel configurations are still supported in the new `Version 3` configuration file format. However, they're being deprecated in favor of endpoints, which provide a simpler and more powerful way of managing ingress. If you wish to see documentation on how to enable and configure tunnels, please refer to the [Version 2 Tunnel Configuration](/docs/agent/config/v2#tunnel-configurations) section._

The most common use of the configuration file is to define endpoint
configurations. Defining endpoint configurations is useful because you may then
start pre-configured endpoints by name from your command line without remembering
all of the right arguments every time. You may also use this method to start as
many endpoints as you like from a single ngrok agent.

Endpoints are defined as mapping of name -> configuration under the `endpoints`
property in your configuration file.

##### Define two endpoints named 'httpbin' and 'demo'

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: httpbin
    url: https://alan-httpbin.ngrok.dev
  - name: demo
    url: https://demo.inconshreveable.com
```

##### Start the endpoint named 'httpbin'

```sh
ngrok start httpbin
```

Each endpoint you define is a map of configuration option names to values. The name of a configuration option is usually the same as its corresponding command line switch with hyphens (`--host-header` becomes `host_header:` in the configuration file and `--url` becomes `url`). All endpoints must define a specific `url` that tells the agent where to send the traffic. Other properties are available and many are protocol-specific.

##### Start all endpoints defined in the configuration file

```sh
ngrok start --all
```

You can configure a single ngrok agent to start multiple endpoints to different services within a single agent session.
