## Tunnel configurations

The most common use of the configuration file is to define tunnel
configurations. Defining tunnel configurations is useful because you may then
start pre-configured tunnels by name from your command line without remembering
all of the right arguments every time. You may also use this method to start as
many tunnels as you like from a single ngrok agent.

Tunnels are defined as mapping of name -> configuration under the `tunnels`
property in your configuration file.

##### Define two tunnels named 'httpbin' and 'demo'

```yaml
tunnels:
  httpbin:
    proto: http
    addr: 8000
    domain: alan-httpbin.ngrok.dev
  demo:
    proto: http
    addr: 9090
    domain: demo.inconshreveable.com
    inspect: false
```

##### Start the tunnel named 'httpbin'

```sh
ngrok start httpbin
```

Each tunnel you define is a map of configuration option names to values. The name of a configuration option is usually the same as its corresponding command line switch with hyphens (`--host-header` becomes `host_header:` in the configuration file and `--scheme` becomes `schemes`). Tunnels can define a specific `proto` or use labels to dynamically connect to one or more matching ngrok Edges. All tunnels must define a specific `addr` that tells the agent where to send the traffic. Other properties are available and many are protocol-specific.

##### Start all tunnels defined in the configuration file

```sh
ngrok start --all
```

You can configure a single ngrok agent to tunnel to multiple services within a single agent session.

##### Common Tunnel Configuration Properties

|            |          |                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addr`     | required | forward traffic to this local port number or network address. This can be just a port                  |
| `metadata` | Optional | arbitrary user-defined metadata that will appear in the ngrok service API when listing tunnel sessions |

| `labels`  | A list of labels (name=value) that can be used to identify a tunnel to an ngrok Edge (specifically a tunnel group backend). | The labels for this tunnel in the format name=value. For example: `edge=edghts_2gYaK9XAVa3ANouaDEPrkeaxkYT` |

##### Define two labeled tunnels

```yaml
tunnels:
  my-cool-website:
    labels:
      - env=prod
      - team=infra
    addr: 8000
    inspect: false
  ssh-tunnel:
    labels:
      - hostname=my-hostname
      - service=ssh
      - team=development
    addr: 22
```

:::tip

When you use labeled tunnels, the `protocol` and `domain` are configured by the matching edge.

:::tip

Edges automatically create an `edge` label, for example: `edge=edghts_2gYaK9XAVa3ANouaDEPrkeaxkYT`
